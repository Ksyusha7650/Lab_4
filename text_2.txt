– Have you thoroughly explored it?, said the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains were seldom unoccupied.
– Yes, yes!, they said, though everybody knew they could not have been long about it; they had come back too quick. It isn't all that big, and it does not go far back.
That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don't know how far they go back, sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kili's news seemed good enough.

Still it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing out into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain. There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze, when they had been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed under the arch, it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks.
