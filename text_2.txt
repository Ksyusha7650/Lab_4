Probably, Keycase reasoned afterward, the awakened sleeper needed a second or two himself to collect his wits, which was why he failed to perceive the initial guilty response of his visitor. But for the moment, conscious of having lost a precious advantage, Keycase swung belatedly into action.
Swaying as if drunkenly, he declaimed, "Wadya mean, wha'm I doin'? Wha' you doin' in my bed?" Unobtrusively, he slipped off the gloves.
– Damn you! This is my bed. And my room!
Moving closer, Keycase loosed a blast of breath, whiskey laden from his gargling. He saw the other recoil. Keycase's mind was working quickly now, icily, as it always had. He had bluffed his way out of dangerous situations like this before.
It was important at this point, he knew, to become defensive, not continuing an aggressive tone, otherwise the legitimate room owner might become frightened and summon help. Though this one looked as if he could handle any contingency himself.
– Your room? You sure?, Keycase said stupidly.
The man in bed was angrier than ever. 
– You lousy drunk! Of course I'm sure it's my room!
– This 's 614?
– You stupid jerk! it's 641.
– Sorry ol' man. Guess 's my mistake. Frorn under his arm Keycase took the newspaper, carried to convey the impression of having come in from the street. Heresa mornin' paper.
– Special livery.
– I don't want your goddam newspaper. Take it and get out!
It had worked! Once more the well–planned escape route had paid off.
Already he was on the way to the door. 
– Said I'm sorry ol' man. No need to get upset. I'm goin'.
He was almost out, the man in bed still glaring. He used a folded glove to turn the doorknob. Then he had made it. Keycase closed the door behind him.
Listening intently, he heard the man inside get out of bed, footsteps pad to the door, the door rattle, the protective chain go on. Keycase continued to wait.
For fully five minutes he stood in the corridor, not stirring, waiting to hear if the man in the room telephoned downstairs. It was essential to know. If he did, Keycase must return to his own room at once, before a hue and cry. But there was no sound, no telephone call. The immediate danger was removed.
Later, though, it might be a different story.
When Mr. 641 awoke again in the full light of morning he would remember what had occurred. Thinking about it, he might ask himself some questions. For example: Why was it that even if someone arrived at the wrong room, their key fitted and they were able to get in? And once in, why stand in darkness instead of switching on a light? There was also Keycase's initial guilty reaction. An intelligent man, wide awake, might reconstruct that part of the scene and perhaps reassess it. In any case there would be reason enough for an indignant telephone call to the hotel management.
Management – probably represented by a house detective – would recognize the signs instantly. A routine check would follow. Whoever was in room 614 would be contacted and, if possible, the occupants of both rooms brought face to face. Each would affirm that neither had ever seen the other previously. The house dick would not be surprised, but it would confirm his suspicion that a professional hotel thief was at large in the building. Word would spread quickly. At the outset of Keycase's campaign, the entire hotel staff would be alert and watchful.
It was likely, too, that the hotel would contact the local police. They, in turn, would ask the FBI for information about known hotel thieves who might be moving around the country. Whenever such a list came, it was a certainty that the name of Julius Keycase Milne would be on it. There would be photographs – police mug shots for showing around the hotel to desk clerks and others.
What he ought to do was pack up and run. If he hurried, he could be clear of the city in less than an hour.
Except that it wasn't quite that simple. He had invested money – the car, the motel, his hotel room, the B–girl. Now, funds were running low. He must show a profit – a good one – out of New Orleans. Think again, Keycase told himself. Think hard.
