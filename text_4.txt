Here Fatty Bolger halted. 
– Good-bye, Frodo! he said. I wish you were not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out. But good luck to you - today and every day!

– If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be lucky, said Frodo. Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can. 
– Good-bye! they cried, and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the tunnel.

It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of thick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.

– There! said Merry. You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and on the edge of the Old Forest.

– Are the stories about it true? asked Pippin.

– I don't know what stories you mean, Merry answered. 

– Is it only the trees that are dangerous? asked Pippin.

– There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the far side, said Merry, or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, east and a little north. That is the path I am going to try and find.

The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy, shaggy growths.

Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. 
– You had better lead on and find that path, Frodo said to him. Don't let us lose one another, or forget which way the Hedge lies!

They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots. There was no undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no sound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.

There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer, and without warning let out a shout.
– Oi! Oi! he cried. I am not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!

The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before.

– I should not shout, if I were you, said Merry. It does more harm than good.

Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood. Merry was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. Pippin noticed it. 
– It has not taken you long to lose us, he said. But at that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead.

– Well, well! he said. –These trees do shift. There is the Bonfire Glade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved away!’
