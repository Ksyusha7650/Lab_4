– Tell us, Master, he said, about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.
– No, don't!, said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. Not now! Not until the morning!

– That is right!, said the old man. Now is the time for resting. Some things are ill to hear when the world's in shadow. Sleep till the morning-light, rest on the pillow! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey willow!
And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room.
